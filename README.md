This is a basic average field microscopic dynamic representation, without considering the quality quantity as well as the distribution.
Multiscale-OER model is a multi-scale model that we construct, and since it is possible to freely conduct a fixed reaction, it is now possible to achieve the tafel slope rate under a real electrical chemistry system. We also have several similar multi-scale methods, and we are also responsible for presenting a model for any modified construction, or any modified model. We hope that this research direction will lead to a systematic gap between small and detailed models.
