MF-MKM is a basic average field microscopic dynamic representation, without considering the quality, quantity, and distribution. 

The Multiscale-OER model is a multi-scale model that we have constructed. This model can be used to simulate the electrocatalytic performance of the OER (Oxygen Evolution Reaction). The file can be directly run for calculations after installing COMSOL version 6.2. We hope that by developing multi-scale models, we can bridge the gap between theoretical calculations and experimental results. We welcome any additions or improvements to the model.
